# Big-Data-Coursework
This project covers the fundamentals of understanding the pre-processing of Big data using Apache Spark and TensorFlow on Google Platform Cloud
------
Working with big dataset it is very tedious and demanding job where choosing the right configuration is important part of big data procedure. We use GCP as a main platform tor testing and experimenting with the image data and using pyspark library that pre-processes by using RDD parallelization. By using the parallelization we can split the work load by using google cloud resource like dataproc cluster for instance. Big data application play major part of the analysing and optimizing and pre-processing the data for the purpose of improving the efficient and time.
